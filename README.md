# Developing

After you create development store, you need to create private app and obtain
password and access with themekit. Here is example of config.yml

~~~
development:
  password: shppa_bb123...123
  theme_id: "99870998695"
  store: trk-themes.myshopify.com
~~~

Note that `config.yml` is git ignored since we do not want to commit to
repository.
